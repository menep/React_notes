# React Notes
It is a simple notepad, where the user can input some text on the right, click on the "save" button, and see it stored on the sidebar.
The user can click on a stored note to see its content.
A stored note can be deleted by clicking on the white 'x'.

## Motivation
I've just started learning React and this is the first project I've worked on.
I've chosen a notes app because it provides the chance to work on a dinamic environment with very basic features, where some text input by a user modifies the state, which reflects this change on other components.

## Practiced features:
- JSX
- Functional and Class components
- Passing props
- Component styling
- Modifying state
- Handling events
- Lists and forms
- Passing unique ids as keys to a list element

## How to install
